Or without sudo (installs to `~/.local/bin`):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsiqbal/sun-cli/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual Installation

#### macOS

**Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4):**

```bash

chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sun
```

**Intel Mac:**

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/itsiqbal/sun-cli/releases/latest/download/sun-darwin-amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/sun
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sun
```

**Universal Binary (works on both):**

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/itsiqbal/sun-cli/releases/latest/download/sun-darwin-universal -o /usr/local/bin/sun
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sun
```

#### Linux

**AMD64:**

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/itsiqbal/sun-cli/releases/latest/download/sun-linux-amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/sun
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sun
```

**ARM64:**

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/itsiqbal/sun-cli/releases/latest/download/sun-linux-arm64 -o /usr/local/bin/sun
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sun
```

#### Windows

**PowerShell:**

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/itsiqbal/sun-cli/releases/latest/download/sun-windows-amd64.exe" -OutFile "sun.exe"
```

Then add the directory containing `sun.exe` to your PATH.

## Updating

### Using the installer

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsiqbal/sun-cli/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

### Using Go

```bash
go install github.com/itsiqbal/sun-cli@latest
```

### Manual update

Download the latest binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/itsiqbal/sun-cli/releases/latest) and replace your existing binary.

## Uninstalling

```bash
# If installed to /usr/local/bin
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/sun

# If installed to ~/.local/bin
rm ~/.local/bin/sun

# If installed via go install
rm $(go env GOPATH)/bin/sun
```

## Troubleshooting

### macOS: "sun" cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified

Remove the quarantine attribute:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /usr/local/bin/sun
```

### Permission denied

Use sudo for system-wide installation:

```bash
sudo curl -L https://github.com/itsiqbal/sun-cli/releases/latest/download/sun-darwin-arm64 -o /usr/local/bin/sun
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sun
```

Or install to user directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
curl -L https://github.com/itsiqbal/sun-cli/releases/latest/download/sun-darwin-arm64 -o ~/.local/bin/sun
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/sun
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"
```

### Command not found after installation

Add the installation directory to your PATH:

**For zsh (macOS default):**

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**For bash:**

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Verifying Downloads

All releases include checksums. To verify your download:

```bash
# Download the checksums file
curl -L https://github.com/itsiqbal/sun-cli/releases/latest/download/sun-cli_VERSION_checksums.txt -o checksums.txt

# Verify (macOS/Linux)
shasum -a 256 -c checksums.txt 2>&1 | grep sun-darwin-arm64

# Or manually
shasum -a 256 sun-darwin-arm64
```
